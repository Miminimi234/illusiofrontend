  const manifestoText = `ILLUSIO exists because markets behave like a simulation that insists it is real. Prices flicker, stories stack on stories, and a quieter signal moves underneath the noise. Our work is to build an instrument that finds that signal early, while action is still cheap and reversible.

We treat every token as an experiment. We start by observing what is actually there, who arrives, who leaves, where the flow holds or slips, and which moves are natural versus staged. We look for the small, honest bends that precede the loud turns. If the world changes, our read changes with it. The instrument updates, and so do we.

Then we clean the record so the history you act on is trustworthy. We strip out planted theatrics and keep what survives a second look. From there, we let tomorrow speak to today. We simulate plausible paths and listen for the footprints they would leave in the present. When those prints appear, we lean in. When they do not, we stand down.

All of this is visible. The Retrocausality Lab shows live flow as pulses through a simple diagram. Branches light, views update, and you watch cause and effect meet in the middle in real time. Every claim is inspectable. Every change of mind is recorded. Confidence comes from evidence, not volume.

This is not prophecy. It is craft. Measure, clean, simulate, compare, then act when the picture is clear and still early. We prefer discipline over noise, transparency over mystique, and reversibility over bravado. Certainty is not available. Clarity is. Our promise is the same each day: clarity before consensus.`;
